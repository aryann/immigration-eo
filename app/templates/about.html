  <h1>About</h1>

  <p>
    <em>Silicon Valley Stands</em> is not a political organization. We are open to every corner of the political spectrum, just as our group’s members represent every corner of the world, every nationality, every religion, ethnicity, gender, age and background. Just like Silicon Valley, we represent the full tapestry of this unique identity we all share: Americans.
  </p>

  <p>

    This includes members of the American workforce from all industries and all categories: native‑born, naturalized, green card/visa holder, refugee and any other.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our commonality is that we stand united to defend the founding principles and values of this country that we all love so dearly. The freedoms we enjoy in America have been earned through blood and sweat; and it is our duty to past generations of Americans, and the generations that will follow us, to be the guardians of those freedoms.
  </p>

  <p>

    The Tech Industry holds a significant place in the US economy, and some of the largest contributions in our industry have been/are made by immigrants and the children of immigrants. Our goal is to harness the collective power of our industry to help protect essential freedoms for all people in this great nation.

  <h1>FAQ</h1>
  <p>
  <em>1. Who can sign the letter?</em><br>
  Any worker from any US industry (or geographic region) can sign the letter. This campaign started as an effort to gather support from the Silicon Valley Tech Industries; but in lieu of the great interest it received from other industries and locations, the effort was expanded to include all US residents working across all industries.
  </p>

  <p>
  <em>2. I think I’ve already signed a similar letter recently; is this the same letter?</em><br>
  Our campaign has evolved and grown quickly! Initially, our letter was sent out from <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfiNUZ8g-eynVnckqymG5E4KaD6ttsP73R655N0WiXEOAo1_Q/viewform?c=0&w=1">this link</a>. If you already signed that letter, you do not need to sign again. Thank you for your support! (We will publish a verified list of signatures periodically. If you’re unsure whether you previously signed this letter, you can check that list.)
  </p>

  <p>
  <em>3. Does the list contain duplicate signatures?</em><br>
  This list of signatories is verified and updated, using both manual and automatic methodologies. All duplicate signatures are periodically resolved.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  <em>4.  I have signed the letter, but have changed my mind. What can I do?</em><br>
  Please fill out <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdnqz1CCnHUy2KbyI13XggZTzLGY8YV5faPYf6Ri0A8dqLTQw/viewform">this form</a> and we will remove your name as soon as possible.
