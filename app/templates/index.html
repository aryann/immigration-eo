  <p>
    We, the undersigned members of the US technology and business community
    support measures that effectively enhance the national security and safety
    of the United States. While we are sympathetic to such efforts, we are
    deeply concerned about the adverse effects of the recent Executive Order
    (EO) which blocks members of our community of Iranian, Iraqi, Syrian,
    Sudanese, Yemeni, Libyan and Somali origin from entering the US. This
    blanket ban, even a short suspension of entry, has adverse effects on the
    US economy to which our businesses have contributed significantly. In
    addition, it causes unnecessary harm and disruption in the daily lives of
    members of American society, and does not serve to advance the national
    interests of the US.
  </p>

  <h2>The US economy depends on the contributions <br> of lawful immigrants from the designated countries. </h2>

  <p>
    They play key roles in major American corporations as entrepreneurs, board
    members, executives, managers, researchers, engineers, designers, lawyers,
    marketers, and more.  Their jobs require them to travel outside the US,
    and the ban not only prevents them from carrying out their duties
    effectively but also severely damages the business flow and economic value
    that they bring to the US. </p>

  <h2>Legal immigrants from the designated countries <br> have been job creators.</h2>

  <p>
    Many well-known, successful American corporations employing tens of
    thousands of Americans are founded by and/or have received key
    contributions from legal immigrants from these countries. Their positive
    impact on the American economy is undeniable and would have been lost if
    they or their families had been prevented from entering the US. There are
    many prominent examples to attest this:

    <ul>
      <li> Steve Jobs, Founder and former CEO of Apple Inc., son of an immigrant from Syria.</li>
      <li> Omid Kordestani, Executive Chairman of Twitter, former SVP at Google Inc., immigrant from Iran.</li>
      <li> Salar Kamangar, SVP at Google Inc., former CEO of YouTube, immigrant from Iran.</li>
      <li> Bob Miner, Co-founder of Oracle Corporation, son of immigrants from Iran.</li>
      <li> Pierre Omidyar, Founder and CEO of eBay Inc., son of an immigrant from Iran.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h2>This Executive Order imposes an undue burden <br> on law-abiding individuals of our community.</h2>

  <p>
    They have worked hard to join our society in pursuit of a better life for
    themselves and their families and have become an integral part of our
    society. This ban separates US Citizens and legal residents from their
    family members internationally, preventing family members to see one
    another. This infringement is detrimental to the family structure of these
    valuable legal immigrants and our society as a whole, and contradicts some
    of our most cherished American values.</p>

  <p>
    We believe the ban has negative consequences that reach beyond the scope
    of national security, and punishes law-abiding, hard-working, and
    well-integrated immigrants who are contributing immensely to the US
    economy.</p>

  <p>
    We disagree with this Executive Order and ask for its withdrawal in the
    name of American values and our national interests.</p>
